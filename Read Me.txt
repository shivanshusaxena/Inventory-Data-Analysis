Inventory Data Analysis:

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project designed to analyze supply chain efficiency by evaluating the balance between product demand and availability

Project Overview:

The core objective of this report is to identify patterns in inventory utilization and financial impact. By calculating daily averages and total profit/loss metrics, the dashboard provides actionable insights into stock shortages and surplus management.

Key Metrics & DAX Calculations:

I developed several custom measures to track performance across the inventory lifecycle:
Supply Dynamics: Calculated Total Demand and Total Availability to determine the Total Supply Shortage, helping to pinpoint where inventory levels fail to meet market needs.
Operational Averages: Utilized the DIVIDE function to establish Average Availability, Demand, and Loss per day for consistent time-series benchmarking.
Financial Impact:

Total Profit: Aggregated positive margins by filtering transactions where LOSS/PROFIT > 0.

Total Loss: Isolated negative margins to quantify the financial hit from overstocking or inefficiencies.

Time Intelligence: Used DISTINCTCOUNT on order dates to normalize data across the total number of operational days.


Technical Implementation:

Tool: Power BI Desktop.
Data Modeling: Integrated a "Demand/Availability" dataset featuring order dates, unit prices, and supply metrics.
Advanced Logic: Used SUMX and FILTER functions to create conditional financial measures that accurately reflect net profit and loss


Key Insights Delivered:

Demand vs. Supply Gap: Identifying the exact volume of Total Supply Shortage to optimize procurement.
Daily Performance: Tracking whether the Average Demand is trending above or below Average Availability.
Profitability Analysis: Visualizing the ratio between Total Profit and Total Loss to evaluate overall business health.
